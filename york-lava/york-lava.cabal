Synopsis:            A library for digital circuit description.
Description:
  York Lava is library for describing digital circuits. Descriptions
  can be simulated in Hugs or GHC, and converted to VHDL compatible with
  XST, the Xilinx Synthesis Tool.  It is similar to Chalmers
  Lava, but omits some features and offers a few new ones.
  See the top-level module "Lava" for pointers to further information.
